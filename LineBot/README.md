# Music Event Line Bot - Tune in Live

## Description
The Music Event Linebot is a group project I led in an online course, designed to help users find music events efficiently. The bot allows users to search for concerts based on time, location, or keywords directly through the LINE app. By integrating multiple technologies, we provided a convenient and interactive experience for music enthusiasts.

> For the key tasks that I covered, please refer to files with (*).
> This project ranked in the top 3 out of 40 group projects in the course.
## Key Features
-   **Concert Search**  
Users can search for upcoming concerts by selecting a date, location, or entering keywords. The data is scraped from four different concert websites.
-   **Music Recommendations**  
Using the Spotify API, users can receive random song recommendations based on their preferred music genre.
-   **Database Integration**  
All concert data is stored and managed using PostgreSQL.
